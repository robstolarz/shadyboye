# shadyboye
this is my attempt at a really simple patch panel based 2d rendering tool, with an emphasis on

* fast composition of rendering code fragments
* easy experimentation with automatic code reload
* being able to produce screenshots and videos quickly

## how to use
get [love2d](https://love2d.org/) and run the `src/` folder with it (more instructions to follow as this becomes more useful)

## is it useful yet
no, unless you enjoy simple and currently useless patch panel implementations
